# The provided script is designed to address the "Cannot change column 'itemnumber': used in a foreign key constraint 'tmp_holdsqueue_ibfk_1'" error that occurs during the upgrade process of the Koha library management software. The error message is as follows:
# Upgrade to 23.06.00.013 [10:07:26]: Bug 28966 - Holds queue view too slow to load for large numbers of holds
# ERROR - {UNKNOWN}: DBI Exception: DBD::mysql::db do failed: Cannot change column 'itemnumber': used in a foreign key constraint 'tmp_holdsqueue_ibfk_1' at /usr/share/koha/lib/C4/Installer.pm line 741
# This error arises when attempting to upgrade Koha to version 23.06.00.013, specifically during the modification of the 'itemnumber' column. The issue lies in the presence of a foreign key constraint named 'tmp_holdsqueue_ibfk_1' that references the 'itemnumber' column, preventing the modification. The script aims to resolve this error by intelligently dropping and re-adding the problematic foreign key in each specified Koha instance.
