# This script installs koha-common and  dependencies on a bare-bones Ubuntu server.
# I've tested this on Ubuntu Server 20.04LTS but it should work on other Debian distros. 
# You will need to configure Apache config files (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/)
# You can copy and paste this script onto your server and make it executable by running "chmod a+x /path/to/file_name"
# To run the script, simply go to "/path/to/file_name" or if it's in your home directory, run "~/file_name" in the CLI.
# This script is interactive, so you'll be prompted for input at various stages.
# You can modify or use this script however you like but I'd really appreciate it if you give me a shout out or attribution if you post it elsewhere :)

# Secure MySQL. You will recieve a number of prompts. This will ask if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN. It is best to answer No.
# Note: Enabling this feature is something of a judgment call.
# If enabled, passwords which donâ€™t match the specified criteria will be rejected by MySQL with an error.
# This will cause issues if you use a weak password in conjunction with software which automatically configures MySQL user credentials, such as the Ubuntu packages for phpMyAdmin.
# It is safe to leave validation disabled, but you should always use strong, unique passwords for database credentials.
